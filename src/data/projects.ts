      "It works as a complete ordering flow rather than a static menu — product discovery, per-item add-ons, and cart management all feed into a validated checkout, the way a real coffee shop's ordering site would need to.",
    technicallyInteresting:
      "Designed in Figma end to end before being built, with a cart that persists to localStorage across pages and browser sessions, per-item add-on modals that recalculate price live, and strict, regex-validated order-form input paired with a custom notification system in place of the browser's built-in alerts.",

    technicallyInteresting:
      "Built solo in a five-day sprint on nothing but HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no framework, no backend — with every transaction persisted to the browser's Local Storage and a category chart kept in sync on every add or delete. It also went past the required scope, shipping four optional stretch features: custom categories, a monthly summary view, transaction sorting, and a dark/light toggle.",
